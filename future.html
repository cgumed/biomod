                  <h1>PCR Application</h1>
                  <p class="lead">
                    <strong><u>Introduction</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCR has been invented for over 30 years, and it is applied to various field. 
                    Therefore, accurate PCR product is crucial to obtain the best result. With the outcome of 
                    our experiment in optimizing the PCR efficiency by incubating the aptamer and nanoparticle 
                    complex with polymerase, we could apply this technique to those several PCR application 
                    below, and further generate the desirable product more efficiently.<br><br>
                    <strong><u>A. Gene expression</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to know gene expression in the tissue in particular time, it is necessary to 
                    reverse transcript mRNA to cDNA and amplify DNA by PCR. This technique also applied in 
                    molecular diagnosis, an analysis of personal genome’s biological marker, which needs PCR to 
                    help. Besides, PCR is also used in distinguishing different kinds of bacteria by their mRNA 
                    expression in the diagnosis of periodontology.[1]<br><br>
                    <strong><u>B. Detection</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By designing specific primers to conduct PCR, sequence variations in alleles in special 
                    tissue can be detected. It is used in genotyping of transgenic organisms and genetic 
                    analyses of mutations in cancer and heredity.[2] Take GMO as an example, GMO 
                    (Genetically modified organism) brings a foreign sequence of DNA. PCR can be used in a wide 
                    kinds of samples, including seed, processed food, finished products. PCR method is applied 
                    to industry and lab test worldwide.[3]<br><br>
                    <strong><u>C. Sequencing</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before sequencing, PCR is used to amplify template DNA to get enough quantity for sequencing. 
                    [4]In these process, it is essential to ensure every nucleotide is correct, or the sequencing 
                    will be inaccurate.[5]<br><br>
                    <strong><u>D. qPCR</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In quantitative PCR (qPCR), the quality of DNA product is the key to receive correct result.  
                    Non-specific binding products being created during the process are raising serious problems, which 
                    affects the amount the target DNA products.  The result of our work diminishes the threat of 
                    non-specific binding in low temperature, therefore optimizing the yield of qPCR.<br><br>
                    <strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCR have a wide range of applications, and the accuracy of PCR 
                    products is undoubtedly important. Our research in aptamer and nanoparticle complex can be 
                    used in all PCR to increase its specificity.

                    <strong><u>A. Aptamer-Based ELISA Technology</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyte-specific aptamers can work as antibodies and can be added to 
                    detect target molecule. By labeling aptamers with fluorophore gold nanoparticles carrying 
                    different colors corresponding to coagulation status[6], it can be easier to be seen by naked 
                    eyes.<br>

                    </span>  
                    <strong><u>B. Biosensors</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispatch test concerning the detection of adenosine and cocaine 
                    through aptamer-link lateral flow device has been brought out.  With the help of gold 
                    nanoparticle’ s color indication, we can observe the test result easily.[7]  Meanwhile, 
                    multiple methods in order to improve its sensitivity are being developed.  Our work provides 
                    an insight in the combination of GO and aptamer, and it’s complex can tackle some problems in 
                    bio-sensors.<br><br>
                    <strong><u>C. Aptamer Probe</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aptamer has high affinity, and thus it can act as probe to attach to 
                    specific receptor. For example, Zhang P et al. indicated that RNA aptamer recognizes proteins 
                    on TNF receptor family and binds to human CD30 on intact cells. By this way, Jurkat cell, a 
                    human T-cell leukemia cell, which doesn’t have CD30 will be detected.[8] Aptamer probe can be 
                    applied to diagnosis and lab test. In our project, combining aptamer with nanoparticle can 
                    enhance its binding.<br><br>
                    <strong><u>D. Electrochemical Detection</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had conjugated the aptamers to graphene oxide which is conductive 
                    material for electrochemical detection. If aptamers combine to targeted protein, electrical 
                    conductivity will be higher. By using the method, rapid detection in biotechnology will be 
                    available in near future.<br>

                <p class="lead">
                    <strong><u>A. Anticoagulation Activity</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a research in 2012, Liao et al found out that thrombin-binding 
                    aptamer-conjugated gold nanoparticles have highly efficient inhibition activity, which 
                    provide even better anticoagulation activity than four commercial drugs. [9] Further, by 
                    this technique, we could expect that those nanomaterials could be a solution for the 
                    incurable disease right now. <br><br>
                    <strong><u>B. A New Way to Combat the Epidemic Outbreak</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an unknown outbreak happens, it always takes a long time for 
                    scientists from getting the virus strain to figuring out the structure of the virus, let 
                    alone inventing a vaccine or treating the infectious disease. If those nanomaterials could 
                    be designed artificially by the technique SELEX, picking out the desired segment which could 
                    be chemically complementary to the specific virus. Then,by inhibiting viruses binding to the 
                    human cells and further prevent infection, those nanomaterials can physically block the 
                    movement of virus. By the development of SELEX, we have faith in this technique could help us 
                    beat the unknown outbreak more quickly and efficiently. <br><br>
                    <strong><u>C. Aptamer as a potential cure of brain cancer</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a network of tiny blood vessels 
                    with a uniform monolayer of endothelial cells that prevents all kind of substance harmful 
                    to brain from entering but also forms an obstacle for drug delivering to brain.In comparison 
                    to antibody, aptamer has a much smaller size, which increases its permeability to tissue and 
                    allows drugs to integrate with it and remains the specificity to its target. Many aptamers 
                    have been generated against proteins expression in glioblastoma cell. By conjugating the 
                    glioblastoma targeting aptamer and transferrin aptamer, the dimer of the two aptamer is able 
                    to transporting across the BBB[10]. As a result, the aptamer dimer might be a great method to 
                    send drugs into brain tissue and increase the specificity of drugs to the brain tumor.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many researches on killing cancer cell by heated nanoparticles 
                    have been done. For example, by coating antibody against specific cancer cell to gold nanoparticles 
                    and heating up the complex by infrared ray (IR), we are able to damage cancer cell accurately 
                    [11,12]. We suppose that replacing antibody by aptamer can not only avoid antibody being broken down 
                    by immune system, but also aid nanoparticle to path through the BBB. To sum up, aptamer might also 
                    improve the surgical treatment on curing brain cancer.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) replicates its genome by 
                    reversing transcription and integrating into host DNA. Aptamer targeting to reverse 
                    transcription polymerase can inhibit virus from replication. Besides, aptamer against 
                    gp120 (viral glycoproteins help to entry), aptamer against nucleocapsid protein, aptamer 
                    against CD4 and CCR5 (block viral entry) are developing now. Also, using nanoparticles to 
                    enhance aptamer can provide greater efficiency. These ideas may become new therapy to cure 
                    AIDS.[13]<br>
