                  <p class="lead">
                    <strong class="subtitle"><u>Introduction</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCR has been invented for over 30 years, 
                    and it is applied to various field. With the outcome of our experiment in optimizing 
                    the PCR efficiency by incubating the aptamer and nanoparticle complex with polymerase,
                     we could potentially improve   these several PCR applications below, and further 
                     generate the desirable product more efficiently.<br><br>
                    <strong class="subtitle"><u>A. Gene expression</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to track gene expression in the tissue, it is necessary 
                    to reverse transcript mRNA to cDNA and amplify DNA by PCR. This technique is also applied 
                    in molecular diagnosis, an analysis of personal genome’s biological marker. Besides, PCR 
                    is also used in distinguishing different kinds of bacteria. For example, in the field of 
                    dentistry, PCR serves as a tool to identify which bacteria causing the periodontal disease.
                    [1] This technique can provide both high sensitivity and specificity within a short period 
                    of time, which has a great potential in clinical application. <br><br>
                    <strong class="subtitle"><u>B. Detection</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By designing specific primers to conduct PCR, sequence 
                    variations in alleles in certain tissue can be detected. It is used in genotyping 
                    of transgenic organisms and genetic analyses of mutations in cancer and heredity.[2] 
                    In the process of genotyping, PCR is a crucial step to amplify specific fragment of DNA 
                    before the detection of the target sequence. Therefore, increasing the sensitivity of PCR 
                    can significantly improve the accuracy of detection of DNA fragment. Take GMO 
                    (Genetically modified organism) as an example, GMO brings a foreign sequence of DNA. 
                    Therefore, conducting genotyping PCR on the GMO products can amplify the foreign DNA.PCR
                     can be used in a wide range of samples, including seeds, processed food, finished products.
                      PCR method is applied to industry and lab test worldwide to examine whether the sample is 
                      a GMO product.[3]<br><br>
                    <strong class="subtitle"><u>C. Sequencing</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, DNA sequencing is an essential technique to develop 
                    precision medicine. If the whole genome sequence of the patient can be deciphered, 
                    it will be much easier for doctors to customize the treatment. For example, the cancer 
                    cell may have different mutation site on each patient, and sequencing helps to identify 
                    the genetic change. PCR is used to amplify template DNA. [4] In these process, it is 
                    essential to ensure the correctness of nucleotide, or the sequencing will be inaccurate.
                    [5]<br><br>
                    <strong class="subtitle"><u>D. qPCR</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In quantitative PCR (qPCR), the amount of DNA product is the key 
                    to receive correct result. Non-specific binding products being created during the process 
                    are raising serious problems, which affects the amount the target DNA products. The result 
                    of our work diminishes the threat of non-specific binding in low temperature, therefore 
                    optimizing the yield of qPCR.<br><br>
                    <strong class="subtitle"><u>Conclusion</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCR have a wide range of applications, and the accuracy of 
                    PCR products is undoubtedly important. Our research in aptamer and nanoparticle complex 
                    can be applied in all PCR to increase its accuracy.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyte-specific aptamers can work as antibodies and can be added to 
                    detect target molecule. By labeling aptamers with fluorophore gold nanoparticles carrying 
                    different colors corresponding to coagulation status[6], it can be easier to be seen by naked 
                    eyes.<br>

                    <strong class="subtitle"><u>B. Biosensors</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispatch test concerning the detection of adenosine and cocaine 
                    through aptamer-link lateral flow device has been brought out.  With the help of gold 
                    nanoparticle’ s color indication, we can observe the test result easily.[7]  Meanwhile, 
                    multiple methods in order to improve its sensitivity are being developed.  Our work provides 
                    an insight in the combination of GO and aptamer, and it’s complex can tackle some problems in 
                    bio-sensors.<br><br>
                    <strong class="subtitle"><u>C. Aptamer Probe</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aptamer has high affinity, and thus it can act as probe to attach 
                    to specific receptor. Compared with antibody, aptamer is much cheaper, and easy to design. 
                    Therefore, it becomes the most potential probe to protein and nucleotide. For example, 
                    Zhang P et al. indicated that RNA aptamer recognizes proteins on TNF receptor family and 
                    binds to human CD30 on intact cells. By this way, Jurkat cell, a human T-cell leukemia cell, 
                    which doesn’t have CD30 will be detected.[8] In the future, aptamer probe can be applied to 
                    diagnosis of many types of disease associated with specific protein receptor, such as cancer, 
                    immune disease, and so on. Also, in the lab test, aptamer probe can be applied to detect target 
                    protein. In our project, combining aptamer with nanoparticle can enhance its affinity to protein 
                    and get multifunction, like imaging and conductivity, which can help to recognize specific 
                    protein.<br><br>
                    <strong class="subtitle"><u>D. Electrochemical Detection</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had conjugated the aptamers to graphene oxide which is conductive 
                    material for electrochemical detection. If aptamers combine to targeted protein, electrical 
                    conductivity will be higher. By using the method, rapid detection in biotechnology will be 
                    available in near future.<br>

                    <strong class="subtitle"><u>A. Anticoagulation Activity</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrombin has played an important role in the blood clotting 
                    cascade process, serving as a protease, activating soluble fibrinogen into insoluble 
                    strands of fibrin. Though there are two well-known thrombin-binding aptamers for thrombin, 
                    they have disadvantages of low flexibility of assembly and low stability of structure, 
                    which lowers their inhibitory potencies. However, recent study has shown that the 
                    nanoparticles can notably stabilize the structure of the aptamers, and further improve 
                    the aptamers’ potencies. In a research in 2012, Liao et al. found that thrombin-binding 
                    aptamer-conjugated gold nanoparticles have highly efficient inhibition activity, which 
                    provide better anticoagulation activity than thrombin-binding aptamers alone and even four 
                    commercial drugs (heparin, argatroban, hirudin, and warfarin). [9] As a result, the study 
                    has confirmed that the complex of aptamer and nanoparticle can be potentially prepared 
                    as efficient drugs. <br><br>
                    <strong class="subtitle"><u>B. A New Way to Combat the Epidemic Outbreak</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Epidemic outbreak is one of the most serious disaster that may 
                    cause serious death toll. When the outbreak happens, time is always the most sticky enemy 
                    in disease control. However, the traditional methods for communicable disease identification 
                    take several days, wasting precious time for patients who are suffering from the infections. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a study of  2013, Chang et al. developed a rapid, 
                    ultra-sensitive, low cost, and non-PCR based method that combines aptamer-conjugated 
                    GNPs and a resonance light-scattering-detection, which could successfully detected 
                    S.aureus cell within 1.5 hour.[10] If we can apply this technique into epidemic control, 
                    with the advantages of rapidity and low-cost, we can detect the potential infection as 
                    soon as possible. Further, this technique not only could be applied to detection, 
                    but also as a way for treatment. In a study of 2007, Jang et al. applied the aptamer 
                    against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus NTPase/ Helicase.[11] 
                    The results suggest that aptamers might potentially serve as useful anti-virus agent. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the control of influenza, we could possibly develop various 
                    aptamers which could target different hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Once one type of 
                    influenza outbreak begins, we could efficiently combine different aptamers and massively 
                    produce them for disease control. Comparing with the traditional way of influenza control, 
                    the vaccine-based strategy  has downsides, such as long manufacturing times, limited global 
                    availability and the side effect of the vaccine itself. Aptamer could serve as a new tool 
                    for the government control the seasonal influenza and the next possible epidemic.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong class="subtitle"><u>C. Aptamer as a potential cure of brain cancer</u></strong><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a network of tiny blood vessels 
                    with a uniform monolayer of endothelial cells that prevents all kind of substance harmful 
                    to brain from entering but also forms an obstacle for drug delivering to brain.In comparison 
                    to antibody, aptamer has a much smaller size, which increases its permeability to tissue and 
                    allows drugs to integrate with it and remains the specificity to its target. Many aptamers 
                    have been generated against proteins expression in glioblastoma cell. By conjugating the 
                    glioblastoma targeting aptamer and transferrin aptamer, the dimer of the two aptamer is able 
                    to transporting across the BBB[12]. As a result, the aptamer dimer might be a great method to 
                    send drugs into brain tissue and increase the specificity of drugs to the brain tumor.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many researches on killing cancer cell by heated nanoparticles 
                    have been done. For example, by coating antibody against specific cancer cell to gold nanoparticles 
                    and heating up the complex by infrared ray (IR), we are able to damage cancer cell accurately 
                    [13, 14]. We suppose that replacing antibody by aptamer can not only avoid antibody being broken down 
                    by immune system, but also aid nanoparticle to path through the BBB. To sum up, aptamer might also 
                    improve the surgical treatment on curing brain cancer.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) replicates its 
                    genome by reverse  transcription and integrating into host DNA. Aptamer targeting to 
                    reverse transcription polymerase can inhibit virus from replication. Besides, aptamer 
                    against gp120 can stop virus from entering into cell, and aptamer against nucleocapsid 
                    protein can prevent virus from assembling. Furthermore, aptamers against CD4 and CCR5 are 
                    able to block the receptor on host cell and inhibit viral glycoprotein to attach on the 
                    receptors. [15]Furthermore, nanoparticles could serve as an enhancer to promote the 
                    efficiency of aptamers. Nanoparticle can not only stabilize the binding of aptamer to 
                    protein  but also be heated to break the structure of virus. These ideas may become a 
                    new therapy to cure AIDS.<br>
